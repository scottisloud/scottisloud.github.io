## WeatherBar Beta Builds
  
### 0.0.4-a2

[Download](/files/weatherbar-004a2.zip)

A minor update with a few quality of life improvements, especially for dark mode users. Some long-awaited features (e.g., displaying conditions in the menu bar) are in the works, but will likely be released alongside a complete refactoring of the application. I expect this next major update to be a ways off. In the meantime I *may* release some minor updates or address serious show-stoppers if they are reported.
There is also some doubt about the future of WeatherBar. The weather service WeatherBar relies on is shutting down next year. Alternatives exist but as far as I have seen these other services are priced too high to make a smaller-scale application like this sustainable. In the meantime, please keep using, testing, and enjoying WeatherBar.

#### Release Notes

- The interface now appears instantly when the icon is clicked. No more sluggish animation.
- Fixed an issue where certain glyphs would not render correctly in dark mode.
