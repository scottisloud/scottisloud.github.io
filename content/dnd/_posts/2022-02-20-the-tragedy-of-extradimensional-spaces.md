Where we left off, your characters emerged from Fistandia's mansion to find Matreous's corpse in the study room he'd rented in the Pillars of Pedagogy. 

Suddenly, Seemingly out of nowhere an imp appears. The statue Matreous had been carrying with him had in fact been a real imp magically bound to the statue. Upon leaving Fistandia's Mansion the magical bonds broke and the Imp attacked and killed him.

The imp, having been invisible, gets the jump on the party, but nevertheless the party prevails, killing the Imp. 

With Matreous dead, your mission to help save the town of Middlevale from it's curse-induced drought has hit a bit of a snag.  

You had a few options: 
- You could try to resurrect Matreous, which would require considerable resources and a very experienced wizard. 
- You could try to find another wizard who could lift the curse. 

The party decided to find another wizard.
