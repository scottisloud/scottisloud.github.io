title: So much for choice and transparency

Regarding the recent signing of the DARK act:

> In fact, according to Obama’s own Food and Drug Administration (FDA), if enacted, the bill would exempt most current GMO foods from being labeled at all. The FDA further commented that it “may be difficult” for any GMO food to qualify for labeling under the bill. And even for any GE foods that might be covered, the bill allows for food to be “labeled” through a digital system of QR codes that can only be accessed if the consumer has a smart phone and reliable internet connectivity.

This is a shame. Regardless of how you feel about GMOs, denying choice and transparency is a bad move. When it comes down to it, no regulation is sometimes better than bad regulation, as it stands this flaccid new regulation just consumes resources with no returns.
