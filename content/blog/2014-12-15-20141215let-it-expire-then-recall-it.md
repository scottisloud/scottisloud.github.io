Recent recall of ground beef for E. coli detected by Food Net, a federally coordinated group that is NOT responsible for enforcement of food safety. Despite the laboratory results from Food Net, it was several days until a recall was issued, and another day after that until it was made public. At that point, the implicated batches of beef had expired. From CBC News:

> The entire food safety system managed by CFIA failed to either detect E. coli-tainted meat in a federally regulated processing facility or recall the problem batch until after any of the fresh meat had likely been consumed or thrown out.
