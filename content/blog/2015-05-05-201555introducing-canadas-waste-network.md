I'm pleased to announce the launch of Canada's Waste Network. This is an initiative that intends to bring together researchers in Canada studying waste. It is a new and growing community and new resources and events will be added regularly. If you are a scholar at a Canadian institution doing research on waste (in Canada or abroad), I'd encourage you to become a member and connect with the community!
