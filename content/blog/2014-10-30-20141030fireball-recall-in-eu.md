title: Fireball Recall in EU
---
Fireball accidentally shipped the North American formula of its cinnamon liquor to the EU, prompting a recall in that jurisdiction. The violative ingredient is&nbsp;propylene glycol which is illegal in food and drugs in the EU, but is legal in the US and Canada. While Food Manufacturing restates, without question, that propylene glycol is safe, and on the FDA's &#8220;Generally Recognized as Safe&#8221; (GRAS) list, the recall should raise warning bells. Anything legal in one jurisdiction but not another should be a red flag.
