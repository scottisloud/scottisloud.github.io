My friend and food studies colleague Sarah hasn't had Tutta la Vita online for too terribly long, yet it has to be one of the most well done food blogs on the internet. Beautiful photos, exquisite web design, and&nbsp;creative recipes make for a pretty top tier combination. Sarah has a Master's degree in Nutritional Science&nbsp;and has a very down-to-earth approach to food. No hard-to-swallow pseudo science, no stagnant and boring &#8220;crash diet&#8221; crap either. Just good wholesome food made with real stuff.&nbsp;

I strongly recommend checking out her&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://tuttalavita.ca/desserts/pomegranate-hazelnut-chocolate-bites/">Pomegranate & Hazelnut Chocolate Bites</a>. We made them for guests recently and they really were an impressive show-stopper.&nbsp;

So go check it out! This is a blog—and a blogger—to keep an eye on.
