<blockquote>
Lidl has recalled some of its yoghurt and peanuts because the packets don't warn customers that they contain milk and nuts.

Allergen labels are immensely important in ensuring the safety of customers with allergies. No doubt there needs to be close monitoring to ensure that consumers with allergies can shop with confidence. Customers with allergies aren't dummies. This recall is borderline insulting.

Either that or it's a scary sign of just how far processed food has come and that consumers have now been trained to know that just because the label says the product is "nuts and yogurt" doesn't mean it contains either of those things.
