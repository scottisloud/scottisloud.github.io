title: How Automobile Recalls Work

>Because federal guidelines change slowly and old people still own cars, automakers must send those notifications as letters—in the mail!—to the registered owners of affected automobiles.

Altogether an interesting article, very similar in a lot of respects to food recalls. The extra few miles that car manufacturers can, and must, take to contact consumers is an interesting contrast with food recalls. Imagine if the same were _possible_ for food manufacturers&#8230; And imagine if they _had_ to do it.
