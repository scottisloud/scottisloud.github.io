### Scott Lougheed

<!-- {: style="text-align: center;"} -->
#### Currently

I am currently a Solutions Architect at [1Password](https://1password.com). I help people implement our enterprise integrations and developer tools into their work.

#### As a human

I am an enthusiastic cook and bread baker, a freelance sound engineer, and tech hobbiest. You may also see me riding my bike around town; fussing over coffee; reading sci-fi, fantasy, and lit-fic; improvosing; and playing guitar.

#### Previously

Once upon a time, I was an environmental social scientist, though I am no longer employed in academia or as a researcher. Most recently I was a postdoctoral fellow in Geography and Planning at the University of Toronto. Prior to that I was a visiting scholar in the department of Agricultural Economics, Sociology, and Education at the Pennsylvania State University. I earned my PhD from the School of Environmental Studies at Queenâ€™s University, Kingston. I also hold Master's (Queen's University) and Bachelor's (University of Victoria) degrees in Sociology.

I still like to nerd out about ontology, governance, and science and technology studies, when the mood strikes.
